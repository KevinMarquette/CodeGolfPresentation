Print the lyrics to the song The 12 Days of Christmas:

On the First day of Christmas
My true love sent to me
A Partridge in a Pear Tree.
â€¦
On the Twelfth day of Christmas
My true love sent to me
Twelve Drummers Drumming,
Eleven Pipers Piping,
Ten Lords-a-Leaping,
Nine Ladies Dancing,
Eight Maids-a-Milking,
Seven Swans-a-Swimming,
Six Geese-a-Laying,
Five Gold Rings,
Four Calling Birds,
Three French Hens,
Two Turtle Doves, and
A Partridge in a Pear Tree.
