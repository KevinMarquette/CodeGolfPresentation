<#
The universe of the Game of Life is a grid of square cells, each of which is either alive ("#") or dead ("."). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
* All other dead cells stay dead.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
* All other live cells die.
Given a 32Ã—32 grid, output the state in the next step. Assume that every cell outside the grid is dead.
